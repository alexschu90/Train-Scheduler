# Train-Scheduler

Purpose: The main focus for this project was to provide a users information on train schedules. It allows the main user to input train name, destination, when the train will arive, and how long (in minutes) before the next arrival.

The technology used was to incorporate a database (Firebase) to update real time and then display the information to the browser using dynamic manipulations. 

The calculations for estimated arrival time and minutes away were completed by using the moment.js library. 

Finally, the styling and layouts were completed using a bootstrap library.
